I've made a web application for predicting house prices in Bengaluru, leveraging the power of data science and machine learning. 

Using Flask for backend development and HTML/CSS for frontend design, I created an intuitive interface that allows users to input various parameters and obtain accurate predictions for house prices in Bengaluru. 

Behind the scenes, I employed data cleaning techniques with Pandas and NumPy, ensuring the quality of the dataset. Outliers were identified and removed to enhance the model's performance. 

The predictive model itself was built using Scikit-learn, employing linear regression to forecast house prices based on factors such as location, size, and more. To streamline the process, I utilized pipelines for efficient one-hot encoding and model deployment.
